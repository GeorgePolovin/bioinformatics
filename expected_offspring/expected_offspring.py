'''
Six nonnegative integers, each of which does not exceed 20,000.
The integers correspond to the number of couples in a population possessing each genotype pairing for a given factor.
In order, the six given integers represent the number of couples having the following genotypes:

AA-AA: 100%
AA-Aa: 100%
AA-aa: 100%
Aa-Aa: 75%
Aa-aa: 50%
aa-aa: 0%

Return: The expected number of offspring displaying the dominant phenotype (AA or Aa) in the next generation, under the assumption that every couple has exactly two offspring.
